 IoU threshold = 50 %, used Area-Under-Curve for each unique Recall 
 mean average precision (mAP@0.50) = 0.000000, or 0.00 % 

Set -points flag:
 `-points 101` for MS COCO 
 `-points 11` for PascalVOC 2007 (uncomment `difficult` in voc.data) 
 `-points 0` (AUC) for ImageNet, PascalVOC 2010-2012, your custom dataset
